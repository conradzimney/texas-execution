				<p>After analyzing the data set of criminal offenders executed since 1982 in the state of Texas, a couple of trends and interesting facts became apparent that I thought could be represented differently via their method of visualization. Some of the dimensions of this data set include the county in which the execution occurred, the race of the executed, and the date of the execution. Some measures that can be drawn from this data set are the number of records (executions) per county or other dimension, as well as the latitude and longitude of the execution based on the county geo-location. </p>
				<p>After reading over the data myself and re-sorting it in an excel file, I noticed that each year generally included a higher number of executions until about 1997 when the number of executions per year remained about the same through 2013. Because of the lack of variety in the dates of the executions, I found that it would not be useful in telling any sort of “story” regarding this data set. Therefore I decided not to include it in <a href="write-up.html">my final visualization</a>. Later, I found that the most variety in the respective dimensions of this data set were in the county, and race of the executed. About half of the counties in the set only had 1 recorded execution, and about 90% had less the 10 executions. Only 4 counties had more than 15 executions, which I found to be an interesting fact and should be further examined. The race of the executed in these execution-heavy counties is also highly varied, and therefore there respective representations/visualizations need to be decided with precision. </p>
				<p>In this situation, race is a nominal data type and is therefore well represented by color. I decided to separate each county’s number of executions into color coordinated pieces representing the percentage of the total executions of a person of a particular race. I chose to represent the quantitative data type that is the number of executions per county with the length of the bar, because length is a very effective method of encoding quantitative data. The different county’s are encoded with text and their different positioning on the y-axis, because positioning is always an effective method for encoding data. Additionally I decided to numerically represent the number of executions for each race in they respective section of the bar length in order to more easily compare them against each other.</p>
				<p>I feel that my final visualization accurately depicts a story of which county’s in Texas had a higher than average number of executions because of criminal offenses. The county with the highest number of executions more than doubled the second most execution-heavy county, and more than half of those executions were black individuals. The top 4 most execution-heavy county’s more than double the number of executions for the fifth highest county as well. All of this information is easily presented from my visualization and I believe is therefore effective at promoting the external cognition of this information to it’s audience. </p>
